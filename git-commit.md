# ```git commit```

## Introduction
```git-commit``` is used to record changes in a git repository.

## Description
Git is a distributed version control system. It simply means more than one person can work on a single file at the same time. However, in order for any version control system to work, we need to have a *way* of indicating/marking/creating these various versions of a file. This is where a **commit** becomes useful.

A commit is the mechanism used to mark a specific point as a point of reference.In Git, a commit is a **snapshot** of the git repository at that particular point in time. The snapshot being the *entire contents of every file* in the repository. But how do we create a commit? 

```git-commit``` is used to record changes in a git repository by creating commits. For ```git-commit``` to work, files to be committed must have been added to a special area called a *staging area* using the command ```git-add```. This allows you to choose the specific files you want committed.
